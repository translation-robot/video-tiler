# Video Tiler
## _A video tiler designed for www.suprememastertv.com_

## _Why a video tiler ?_
Multiply the benefits of Supreme Master TV live stream:
https://suprememastertv.com/en1/v/245875177398.html

## Features:
* Graphical user interface to select any video URL, number of tiles and auto restart
* Has list of SMTV streams (youtube, x.com, etc)
* Auto restart video on error optional
* Cross platform, will work on windows, linux and Mac

From my core i7 processor, tiling can go up to 64x64 tiles

## What is missing:
* A version update checker
* Instructions about using the tool, using alt-tab, esc to stop video etc

## Problems:
* Compiled with pyinstaller and can be detected as containing virus despite not having any (switch to other languages ?)

## Download windows binaries
